Usage
=====

Heritage.py has two possible modes of operation,

1. Using a web mirror

This mode uses any compatible web mirror of The Heritage Platform
(e.g. https://sanskrit.inria.fr/index.en.html) and does not require any installation, however,
HTTP requests are made for every task resulting in a larger delay.


2. Using a local installation

**Installation Instructions: https://sanskrit.inria.fr/manual.html#installation.**

This mode requires a local installation of The Heritage Platform. As
a result, it is considerably faster in obtaining results.


To use Heritage.py in a project,

.. code-block:: python

    import heritage
